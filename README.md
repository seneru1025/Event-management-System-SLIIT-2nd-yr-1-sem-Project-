Event Management System
This repository contains the Event Management System developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) module assignment for the 2nd Year 1st Semester at SLIIT. The project is implemented in Java and focuses on applying core OOP principles to solve real-world problems efficiently.

Overview
The Event Management System is designed to streamline the planning, organizing, and management of events. It simplifies the process for event coordinators and participants by automating key aspects like registration, scheduling, and resource management.

Key Features:
User Registration: Allows users to sign up for events, and manage their profiles and event preferences.
Event Creation & Management: Admins can create, update, and delete events. They can manage event details like time, location, and participant limits.
Participant Enrollment: Facilitates seamless registration for participants, allowing them to sign up for multiple events.
Event Scheduling: Automatically handles event scheduling to avoid time conflicts and overlap.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java
IDE: Eclipse
Database: MySQL

Object-Oriented Concepts Applied:
Encapsulation: Protects the data within objects, ensuring that only authorized methods can access or modify it.
Inheritance: Reusability of code through inheritance for common event types, users, etc.
Polymorphism: Supports flexibility by allowing methods to perform differently based on the object that invokes them.
Abstraction: Simplifies complex systems by modeling key functionalities relevant to events and users.
